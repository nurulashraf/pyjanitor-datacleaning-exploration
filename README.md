# Pyjanitor Data Cleaning Exploration

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to use **Pyjanitor**, a Python library built on top of `pandas`, to simplify and streamline data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.

## Overview

The notebook showcases the use of several powerful `pyjanitor` functions, including:

* `clean_names()` â€“ Standardises column names to snake\_case.
* `rename_column()` â€“ Easily rename columns.
* `fill_empty()` â€“ Handling missing values.
* `select_columns()` â€“ Select only the columns you need.
* Method chaining â€“ Perform multiple operations in a single, clean line of code.

These tools help make your data wrangling workflow more readable, efficient, and pythonic.

## Contents
